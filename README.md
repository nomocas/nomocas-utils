# nomocas-utils

Bunch of small and atomic vanilla js utilities in CommonJS format.

Some are catched from the web, others are written by myself and often heavily inspired from other works.

## Modules

- query-string.js : queryString string parser
- url-parser.js : url string parser
- date-format.js : atomic but quite complete and elegant date formatter (from Steven Levithan, Kris Kowal and Scott Trenda) 
- emitter.js : small emitter
- object-utils.js : copy, shallowCopy, get/set properties by path, ...
- promise-log.js : add .log and .logError in Promise prototype (assuming it exists). useful for debugging.
